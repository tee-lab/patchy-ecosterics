# vegetation-dynamics
Investigating cluster dynamics in models of patchy ecosystems
This repository is organized as follows:

1) Operational scripts in the root folder: terminal.py should be used for running jobs, compile_changes.py performs all the analysis and dumps data in a folder named "outputs" located in the root, and plot_changes.py generates graphs from the aforementioned data
2) This project explores several models.  Every model has different variations of scripts that return/save different data and are optimized for different purposes. The data generated by these scripts are dumped in the same folder and analyzed by the compile_changes.py file
3) cluster_dynamics.py looks at two lattices that differ by a single update and returns (a) process undergone by the lattice (growth, decay, split, merge, appearance, disappearance), (b) sizes of the participating cluster(s), and (c) sizes of the resulting cluster(s)
4) The code_snippets folder contains grouped lines of code for analyzing specific aspects of each model. These can be readily copied and modified in the terminal.py script
5) The "fitters" folder contains Python and R scripts that fit (a) cluster size distribution and (b) cluster dynamics to power-law, truncated power-law and exponential distributions using the spatialwarnings package
