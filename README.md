Investigating cluster dynamics in models of patchy ecosystems

## Models

This repository contains code to simulate the following models/automatons:
1) Static null model: A 2D lattice that is randomly assigned with 0's and 1's, based on some occupational probability 'p'. Used as benchmark for percolation transitions
2) Stochastic null model: A model that is initialized with some fractional occupancy 'f', and evolves in a completely random manner (0 -> 1, 1 -> 0) whilst hovering around the initialized fractional occupancy. Proposed in [Kefi et. al](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01553.x). Used as control for cluster dynamics
3) Tricritical Directed Percolation (TDP): The central model of this project. Proposed in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0608339). Initialized with two parameters, (p, q), the working of this model is decrbied by the following schematic from [Sankaran et. al](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13304)

4) Scanlon Model: This model is from [https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06060](Scanlon et. al). The only parameter in this model is rainfall. Ubiquitously produces power-law distribution in cluster sizes. Used in addition to gauge how cluster dynamics varies across models. This model is simulated using Markov chain Monte Carlo method, with the following transition rates:

5) Contact Process: Tricritical Directed Percolation with q = 0 is known as Contact Process. Infact, TDP is actually an extension of this model

The repository is organized as follows:

1) Operational scripts in the root folder: terminal.py should be used for running jobs, compile_changes.py performs all the analysis and dumps data in a folder named "outputs" located in the root, and plot_changes.py generates graphs from the aforementioned data
2) This project explores several models.  Every model has different variations of scripts that return/save different data and are optimized for different purposes. The data generated by these scripts are dumped in the same folder and analyzed by the compile_changes.py file
3) cluster_dynamics.py looks at two lattices that differ by a single update and returns (a) process undergone by the lattice (growth, decay, split, merge, appearance, disappearance), (b) sizes of the participating cluster(s), and (c) sizes of the resulting cluster(s)
4) The "code_snippets" folder contains grouped lines of code for analyzing specific aspects of each model. These can be readily copied and modified in the terminal.py script
5) The "consistency_checks" folder contains scripts that simulate the inferred stochastic differential equations from a realisation and compares the resultant distribution to the actual distribution
6) The "fitters" folder contains Python and R scripts that fit (a) cluster size distribution and (b) cluster dynamics to power-law, truncated power-law and exponential distributions using an R package called spatialwarnings
7) A folder named "outputs" is generated during runtime, for dumping .txt files (generated by compile_changes.py) and .png files (generated by plot_changes.py). Within this folder, organizer.py can be used to group files with same prefix into a single folder. These folders were then moved to the "results" section
8) The "plotters" folder contains scripts uses data from the "results" folder to generate figures for thesis/publication
