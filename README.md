# vegetation-dynamics
Studying cluster dynamics in semi-arid vegetation

Project organization:
1) Analysis scripts at root
2) The models folder, containing standalone scripts
3) The results folder

The time series data of every model is dumped in the same folder as the model. 
An info.txt file is also auto-generated, containing the parameters under which each simulation was carried out.
