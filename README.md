# vegetation-dynamics
Studying cluster dynamics in semi-arid vegetation

Project organization:
1) Analysis scripts at root
2) All models and their simulation data inside the models folder

The time series data of every model is dumped in the same folder as the model
It also contains an info.txt file that stores the parameters under which each simulation was carried out
