All models associated with this project may contain the following script(s).
All of them essentially simulate the same model, but return/save different data and are optimized for the suited purpose

The dumper.py script simulates the model in question without analysing cluster dynamics, and returns the averaged final density
This is ideal for generating phase diagrams

The final_lattice.py script also does the same, but also saves the final lattice configurations from every ensemble
This data is required for statistical fitting of power-laws on the cluster size distribution

The in_place_processing.py script carries out cluster dynamics after every step of the simulation
This is the main script used in this project. The others are modifications of this script for specific purposes

The spanning_cluster.py script simulates the model in question and returns the fraction of ensembles that feature a percolating cluster
This is ideal for analysing percolation transitions
